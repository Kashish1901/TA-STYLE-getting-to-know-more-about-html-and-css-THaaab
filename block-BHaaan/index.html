                    <p>When our loved ones make a mistake we often forgive them easily, but when we make a mistake we are often too hard on ourselves.</p>
                <p>The first step of self-love is realising that we are only human and it is okay to make mistakes; it is okay to lose at times; it is okay to not have the best day…week…or month.</p>
                <p>All we need to do is love ourselves and let the negative things pass through; eventually things will change and bad times will pass.</p>
                <p>Self-love has many benefits; the first benefit is greater life satisfaction. When we love ourselves more we instantly change our perspective of the world. Self-love can give us a more positive attitude towards life.

                    The second benefit of self-love is that it can encourage us to pick up good habits. Self-love means loving your body, soul, and mind. Therefore, people who love themselves often refrain from doing things that will have an impact on their tranquility. Thus, it can help us adapt healthy habits.
                    
                    If you start loving your body and mind more than others, you will not work during weekends; you will rather go on a drive or do some other activity that relaxes your mind.
                    
                    Another important benefit of self-love is better mental health. People who love themselves are less likely to suffer from anxiety or depression; self-love also paves the way to a positive mindset which is an essential ingredient for success in life and for mental wellbeing.</p>

                    <p>I wake up in the morning in the best mood from the kisses my dogs
                        give me. I love my pet dogs because they’re nice, cute, funny, and full
                        of unconditional love. I like to take care of my pets by giving them
                        food, water, and playing lots with them. I love to take my dogs
                        outside for some fresh air and sunshine. Sometimes my mom will let
                        me take my dogs for a walk and we go to the park and let them run
                        around. I love running around with my dogs! We even go to the
                        beach sometimes and they love to run around kicking up the sand. I
                        love that my dog’s hair is super fluffy and they let me wash it and
                        play with it. One of my dogs will even walk right in the shower with
                        me!</p>
                        <p> They also love the blow-dryer and try to
                        bite at the warm air. I love my dogs because
                        they snuggle up, make me feel safe, and love me
                        as much as I love them. My pets make me happy
                        and the work a happier place. I love my dogs so
                        much and they are very special to me</p>
