                <h2>Benefits of Having More Than One Dog or Cat</h2>
                <h3>Pets Keep Each Other from Becoming Bored or Lonely.</h3>
                <p>There are obvious benefits to owning multiple pets at the same time. Your pets will have the opportunity to socialize and play together, which means they won’t get bored if you’re working, sleeping or out of the house for a few hours. They’ll never have to be alone except when they want to be.  </p>
                <p>Two pets also mean more companionship for the people in your family. Each pet has its own personality. You and your family will enjoy getting to know each one as an individual. Dogs and cats can become attached to more than just one owner. When there is more than one pet in the home, they may each get attached to different people in the family. </p>
                <h3>Pets Help Each Other Get More Exercise</h3>
                <p>In addition to boosting their mental health, having a fellow animal companion can also improve your pets’ physical health. As dogs and cats grow older, lack of exercise can lead to various medical problems. </p>
                <p>Pets often play with each other throughout the house. This activity can give them a lot more exercise than they’d get alone.  </p>
                <h2>Benefits of Owning Multiple Dogs or Cats for People</h2>
                <h3>Pets Provide Mental Health Benefits for Their Owners</h3>
                <p>Any pet owner can tell you that feeling they get when their dog or cat runs up to greet them or cuddles up with them during a quiet moment. For many, it’s a feeling that life’s stressors are melting away or at least being put on hold.  </p>
                <p>It’s more than just a feeling, though. The stress-reducing effects of owning a cat or dog are well documented. Did you know interacting with a dog can decrease the stress-causing hormone known as cortisol and increase oxytocin levels (the love hormone) in both people and their dogs?</p>
            <h3>Pets Provide Physical Health Benefits for Their Owners</h3>
            <p>Pet ownership also offers some surprising physical health benefits, which can compound when you have multiple pets. According to studies, having a pet can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels.  

                Dogs need plenty of daily exercise, either through walks or with games of fetch or tug. In the process, you’re also getting a workout. The same goes for playing and interacting with your cats. 
                
                Perhaps even more surprising are the effects petting your dog or cat have on cardiovascular health. Studies show talking to and petting a dog can help to lower blood pressure and heart rates leading to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.  
                
                Your immune system can also benefit from having pets, as exposure to dogs and cats can reduce allergen sensitization and influence immune function.  </p>

                <h1>What to Consider Before Giving a Dog as a Gift</h1>
                <p>One of the most popular holiday gifts, whether for a romantic partner or child, is a puppy. Purina expert Dr. Marty Becker endorses the practice, as the “holiday break is the single best time to adopt a pet from the shelter because the family members are all home. There’s a lot of vacation days so there’s time to spend training and socializing.”</p>
                <h2>3 Things to Consider Before Giving a Dog as a Gift</h2>
                <h3>1. What the Recipient Wants</h3>
                <p>It’s best to ask the recipient outright whether they want a dog, but that ruins the element of surprise. So, be diligent and do your homework.

                    Even if they love dogs, consider why they don’t currently have one. They may have a good reason, like working long hours. Some can’t afford the unexpected costs that often come with pet ownership, like veterinarian bills, medications and more.</p>
                  <h3>2. Their Lifestyle</h3>  
                  <p>Lifestyle is another important consideration to ensure the recipient and dog are a good match. If the person is active, they may want an energetic dog to go for runs or long walks.

                    On the other hand, if the dog will be a companion for your elderly grandmother, a calm and relaxed pup is a better choice. Other lifestyle factors to consider include whether the recipient does a lot of traveling or if there are children or other pets involved.</p>
                    <h3>3. Home Environment</h3>
                    <p>Even small dogs need room to play, and all dogs need an outdoor space to go to the bathroom. Consider the size and location of the recipient’s home, whether they have a yard and if it’s fenced.

                        If they live in an apartment with little to no outdoor space, a small dog may be better than a large breed. Environment, lifestyle and the recipient’s own desires will dictate the type of dog that’s best.</p>
                        <p>If you’ve considered all the above and still think giving a dog as a gift is a good idea, you need to choose the best way to give him to the recipient. Placing a puppy in a box with holes poked in it and wrapped up under the tree isn’t a good option. It’s dangerous and traumatic for the dog. You can maintain an element of surprise without doing this.

                            Rather than putting the dog under the tree, buy a dog toy, stuffed dog, or supplies like a leash and collar or food bowls and wrap those instead. When the recipient opens the gift(s), tell them your intentions to get them a dog and explain you’ll pay the adoption fee.
                            
                            This allows them to pick the dog out themselves at a more convenient time, such as after the holidays. They can start their search on Petfinder.com to find the perfect dog at a shelter or rescue near them.</p>
