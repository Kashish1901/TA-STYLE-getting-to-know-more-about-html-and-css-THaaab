            <h2>Do Cats Drink Water? Cat Hydration & Dehydration Prevention</h2>
            <p>Water, however, is as vital to a cat’s survival as it is to that of humans. 60-70% of their body weight is water. Despite being good for them, many cats don’t like drinking water, especially if it’s still or standing water. This dislike for water can lead to a dehydrated cat, so it’s important to monitor your cat’s water intake. </p>
            <h2>Why is Proper Hydration Important for Cats?</h2>
            <p>Hydration is the physiological state of balanced electrolytes, specific minerals and fluids within the body, and maintaining this balance is important. Water is vital because it affects everything from organ function and nutrient transportation to circulation and digestion.  
        
                It also helps decrease the likelihood of urinary stones and helps the kidneys flush out toxins.  
                
                All cats are different and have their own preferences, though. As a result, you may need to try a few different methods of providing water to find something your kitty likes.  </p>

<h2>Wet vs. Dry Cat Food: Which is Better?</h2>
<p>If you’ve wondered which is better when it comes to wet vs. dry cat food, they’re both excellent choices. Just make sure the food you select is 100 percent complete and balanced for your cat’s age and life stage. While some cats (and cat owners) prefer one over the other, the best option may be to feed your cat both.</p>
<h2>Wet vs. Dry Cat Food</h2>
<h3>Wet Cat Food</h3>
<p>You’re probably familiar with the wet food in cans, but you may also find it in pouches. Both “come in small sizes, making it easy to provide a variety of different flavors, and for some, smaller sizes may make portion control easier,” says Purina Veterinary Nutritionist Dr. Dorothy Laflamme.</p>
<p>Wet cat food has at least 65 percent or more moisture content. As a result, “wet food should not be left out for more than 30 to 60 minutes at a time to prevent bacterial growth,” according to Laflamme.</p>
<p>Wet cat food offers many benefits, though, including:</p>
<p>-Textures and ingredients cats love<br>
   - Easier for cats to chew<br>
    -More variety in diet<br>
    Helps increase total water intake</p>
