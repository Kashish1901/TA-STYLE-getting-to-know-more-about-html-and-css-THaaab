                <h2>How to Adopt a Dog</h2>
                <p>Adopting a dog is a big step. There are a lot of things to consider, from choosing the right one for your lifestyle to deciding where to adopt from. Let us help you find the perfect canine companion. </p>
                <h2>Choosing the Perfect Dog for You</h2>
                <p>To find the perfect dog for you, you’ll have to do some research. By exploring various breeds, their energy levels, grooming needs and more, you can ensure the dog you bring into your home fits seamlessly into your life. You can use our breed selector, which asks a series of questions about your lifestyle and preferences to suggest appropriate breeds. You can also explore different breeds on our site, sorting by athleticism, appearance and other factors to find the right dog for you. </p>
            <h2>Where to Adopt Your Dog</h2>
            <p>Once you understand the type of dog you’re looking for, it’s time to start your search. There are plenty of options when it comes to adopting a dog, which we’ve outlined below.</p>
             <p><strong>-Breeder:</strong>You may want to visit a breeder if you’re looking for a specific breed and have questions about personality, health conditions and other considerations. Keep in mind, this is probably the most expensive route, but by going through a reputable breeder, you know exactly where your dog came from and may even have the opportunity to meet his litter mates, mother and father.</p>
              <p><strong>-Shelters:</strong>If you want a purebred dog but prefer not to go through a breeder, shelters are another great option. They often have a surprising number of purebreds and many other types of dogs. These facilities house animals for many different reasons and are operated by organizations dedicated to animal welfare, like a humane society, or by a municipal or county government. They usually have a wide variety of dogs in need of loving homes, and some may have already acquired basic house training and cooperative skills.  </p>
        <p><strong>-Rescue organizations:</strong>Like shelters, rescue organizations are dedicated to animal welfare, but they may not have a dedicated facility to house and care for their adoptable pets. Rescues care for a much smaller number of animals through a network of private foster homes rather than in a shelter. Volunteers or staff members often foster one or more animals at a time to provide temporary, in-home care. As foster parents care for pets in their home, they learn a lot about the dog’s personality and behavior. In most cases, you can contact the rescue group and request to visit adoptable pets in foster homes to determine if they’re a good fit. </p>

        <h2>4 Benefits of Dogs and Children Growing Up Together</h2>
        <p>Most children love dogs. They're cute, cuddly, and oh-so-friendly. But did you know that growing up with a dog can actually benefit a child's physical and psychological development? Here are some of the many benefits of dogs being in children's lives.</p> 
         <h2>Benefits of Kids and Dogs Growing Up Together</h2> 
         <h3>1. Constant Companionship</h3>
         <p>Although childhood isn't always easy, having a pet provides constant companionship through the ups and downs. Dogs can be a great source of comfort for kids — even when they're coming to grips with difficult life lessons. Whenever kids feel sad, angry, or afraid, they can always turn to their pet. Petting and cuddling dogs has also been shown to relieve stress and help people relax.</p>
         <h3>2. A More Active Lifestyle</h3>
         <p>Although childhood isn't always easy, having a pet provides constant companionship through the ups and downs. Dogs can be a great source of comfort for kids — even when they're coming to grips with difficult life lessons. Whenever kids feel sad, angry, or afraid, they can always turn to their pet. Petting and cuddling dogs has also been shown to relieve stress and help people relax.</p>
         <h3>3. Learning Responsibility</h3>
         <p>Having a pet is a great way to teach responsibility to kids. Making sure that the family dog has food and water gives children a first glimpse of accountability and obligation. Children also learn empathy and compassion by caring for their pet, while developing a higher level of self-esteem by taking care of their pet-owning responsibilities.</p>
         <h3>4. Health Is Wealth</h3>
         <p>Studies have found that babies raised in close contact with a pet get sick less often in their first year of life, meaning fewer visits to the doctor's office. Exposure to pet dander and the microbes that pets carry into the home from the outdoors is suggested to improve babies' developing immune systems. Research has also found that children who grow up with dogs experience a reduced risk of allergies.</p>
